# Collaborative-workspace

### Co-act - An online Collaborative workspace for remote work


It is a web-based application that aims to bring our teamâ€™s work together in one shared space, allowing people to collaborate no matter where you are. The main focus is to organize and assign tasks. With this structure, teams can immediately see what they need to do, which tasks are assigned by the leader, and when work is due.
